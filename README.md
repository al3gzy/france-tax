# France Tax Analysis

## Introduction
This R script performs an in-depth statistical analysis on tax data from France. The script includes various sampling techniques, such as pilot sampling, stratified sampling and optimization of sample size. It calculates confidence intervals for tax estimations and population projections. The main goal is to estimate tax distributions, population sizes and other important metrics with a high degree of accuracy.

## Features
- **Pilot Sampling**: Estimation of tax and population variances based on pilot samples.
- **Optimal Sample Size Calculation**: Determines the required sample size for accurate tax and population estimations.
- **Stratified Sampling**: Uses stratified sampling methods for more precise estimations in different French regions.
- **Confidence Intervals**: Calculates and provides confidence intervals for estimated tax values and population counts.
- **Bias Estimation**: Evaluates the bias in sample-based estimates over multiple iterations.
- **Population Projections**: Estimates the total population size based on the sampling data and computes confidence intervals for these projections.
- **Variance Analysis**: Performs variance estimation for tax predictions and coefficient estimations.
